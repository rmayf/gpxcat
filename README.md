This is a fork of the gpxcat utility. I'm interested in extending this to also support .FIT files (Garmin activity recording format).  [gpspbabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html) is used to convert the .FIT to .gpx before cating them together.


Original
======

This is the script to concatenate few or more GPX tracks into one file.

Installation
------------

    easy_install gpxcat

Usage
-----

    gpxcat track1.gpx track2.gpx track3.gpx > output.gpx
